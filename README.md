## Lymphopenia predicts disease severity of COVID-19: a descriptive and predictive study
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-0148-4  
The article “Lymphopenia predicts disease severity of COVID-19: a descriptive and predictive study” written by Li Tan and other authors and published March 27th of 2020 evaluated the prognosis of patients based on blood lymphocyte percentage (LYM%). 12 death cases were evaluated and showed that LYM% was less than 5% within 2 weeks after disease onset. Seven severe cases showed an initial LYM% decreased then increased to above 10% until discharged. The 11 moderate cases showed little fluctuation in LYM% and was higher than 20% until discharge. LYM% levels that are higher show a less severe case of COVID-19 and patients with LYM% 's that are less than 5% resulted in a high mortality rate and need for intensive care. 

## Estimating clinical severity of COVID-19 from the transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China

The article “Estimating clinical severity of COVID-19 from the transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China” written by Joseph t. Wu and published on March 19th of 2020 evaluated the severity of COVID-19 by cases and deaths data from Wuhan China. The assessment of COVID-19 for clinical severity is important to ensure proper medical intervention is recommended to delay or prevent symptoms and death. The probability of death after developing symptoms was 1.4% in Wuhan. Age was a major determining factor that showed those aged below 30 and above 59 years were 0.6 and 5.1 times more likely to die after developing symptoms respectively. The risk for symptomatic infection increased with age as well.
